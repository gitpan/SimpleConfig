SimpleConfig


Designed to be simpler than the ConfigReader module, firstly it
seemed like overkill for what I wanted, and secondly I couldn't
figure it out :)

At this early stage (ie:  I coded it last night) it's still got
some major limitations/bugs - see the pod docs for details.

And the 'make test' stuff is completely rudimentary.  More will
follow.


Contacting me:  gossamer@tertius.net.au is best.
