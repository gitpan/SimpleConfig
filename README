DECRIPTION

 Provides a convenient way for loading   config values from a given file and
  returns it as a hash structure, allows interpolation for the   perl scalars ( $xxxx ${xxx} )
  and inside of XML fragments as well.
  Also, it can run interactive session with user, use predefined prompts, use validation patterns
  and store back into the file, preserving the original order of the comments and definitions.
    Motivation behind this module was inspired by Config::General module which was missing required
  functionality ( preservation of the comments order and positioining, prompts and validation for 
  command line based UI ). Basically, this is Yet-Another-Config-Module with some subset of the
  functionality and list of features found to be useful.
